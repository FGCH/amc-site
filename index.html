                <p>Our project uses <a href="#badbank">public asset management companies ('bad banks')</a> as a window for studying the reasons and ways that politicians respond to financal crises. Our research has led us to also examine related issues such as financial crisis data quality and transparency, as well as the impact that federalism has on policy responses to financial crises.</p>
